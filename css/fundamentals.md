# 100 CSS & CSS3 Interview Questions with Answers

## 1. What is CSS and what are its benefits?
**Answer:** CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. Benefits include separation of content from presentation, consistent styling across multiple pages, improved page loading times, and responsive design capabilities.
**Frequency:** Very High (90%)
**Companies:** All tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook



## 2. Explain the difference between classes and IDs in CSS.
**Answer:** Classes can be used multiple times on a page and are defined with a period (.class-name). IDs must be unique to a single element on a page and are defined with a hash symbol (#id-name). IDs have higher specificity than classes.
**Frequency:** Very High (85%)
**Companies:** Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter



## 3. What is the box model in CSS?
**Answer:** The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree. The standard box model calculates width and height based on the content only, while the alternative box-sizing model (border-box) includes padding and border in the width/height calculation. The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. Every HTML element is considered a box, which consists of the following components (from innermost to outermost):

Content: The actual content (text, image, etc.)
Padding: Space between the content and the border
Border: The edge surrounding the padding (and content)
Margin: Space between the elementâ€™s border and surrounding elements

## BOX MODEL

+-------------------------------+
|           Margin              |
|  +------------------------+   |
|  |        Border          |   |
|  |  +------------------+  |   |
|  |  |    Padding       |  |   |
|  |  |  +------------+  |  |   |
|  |  |  |  Content   |  |  |   |
|  |  |  +------------+  |  |   |
|  |  +------------------+  |   |
|  +------------------------+   |
+-------------------------------+


ðŸ§  Explanation with Example:

```html
    <div class="box">Hello</div>
```

```css
    .box {
    width: 200px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 5px solid black;
    margin: 20px;
    }
```

Total width =
200 (width) + 10*2 (padding) + 5*2 (border) = 230px

Total height =
Same calculation applies for height (if specified similarly).

Use box-sizing: border-box to include padding and border within the width/height.

```css
    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
```

## 84. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?
**Answer:** 
- Block-level elements start on new lines and take full width available (div, p, h1-h6)
- Inline elements don't start new lines and only take necessary width (span, a, img)
Block elements can contain other blocks and inlines; inline elements generally contain only data and other inline elements.
**Frequency:** High (75%)
**Companies:** Apple, Google, Shopify, Pinterest



## 85. What is viewport units (vh, vw) and how do they differ from percentages?
**Answer:** 
- vh/vw are relative to viewport size (1vh = 1% of viewport height)
- Percentages are relative to parent container size
Viewport units are useful for full-screen layouts and are unaffected by scrolling.
**Frequency:** High (70%)
**Companies:** Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb, Spotify



## 86. How do CSS Grid and Flexbox complement each other?
**Answer:** CSS Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns simultaneously), while Flexbox is optimal for one-dimensional layouts (either row OR column). They can be used together - Grid for page-level layout and Flexbox for component-level design.
**Frequency:** High (65%)
**Companies:** Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Uber



## 87. What is the difference between "grid-template" and "grid" shorthand properties?
**Answer:** 
- grid-template is a shorthand for grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas
- grid is a complete shorthand that also includes grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow
**Frequency:** Medium (45%)
**Companies:** Google, Adobe, LinkedIn, PayPal



## 88. What are CSS transforms?

## 95. What is CSS pointer-events property?
**Answer:** pointer-events controls how an element responds to mouse/touch events. Setting it to "none" makes the element ignore pointer events, passing them to elements behind it. Useful for overlays or temporarily disabling interactions.
**Frequency:** Medium (50%)
**Companies:** Amazon, Twitter, Pinterest, Uber



## 96. What are CSS Subgrids?
**Answer:** Subgrid allows nested grids to inherit track sizes from their parent grid, enabling content alignment across nested grid structures. It's part of CSS Grid Level 2 specification.
**Frequency:** Low (30%)
**Companies:** Apple, Google, Adobe, Airbnb



## 97. What is CSS contain property?
**Answer:** The contain property improves performance by isolating an element's content from the rest of the document. Values include:
- layout: Element is independent for layout purposes
- paint: Element's descendants don't display outside its bounds
- size: Element's size doesn't depend on its children
**Frequency:** Low (25%)
**Companies:** Facebook, Microsoft, Spotify, PayPal



## 98. What are CSS Container Queries?
**Answer:** Container queries allow styling elements based on the size of their container rather than the viewport. This enables truly responsive components regardless of where they're placed in the layout.
```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;

## 101. Explain BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology and when you would use it.
**Answer:** BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a CSS naming convention that creates reusable components through a clear structure. It uses the format `.block__element--modifier`. Blocks are standalone components, elements are parts of blocks (identified with double underscore), and modifiers are variations or states (identified with double dash). BEM is particularly useful for large projects with multiple developers as it creates a clear, strict naming structure that avoids cascade conflicts and improves code readability and maintainability.
**Frequency:** High (70%)
**Companies:** Airbnb, Shopify, BBC, Yandex, Uber



## 102. Compare and contrast CSS methodologies: BEM vs SMACSS vs OOCSS.
**Answer:** 
- BEM (Block Element Modifier): Uses strict naming conventions with block__element--modifier pattern. Strengths: clear component relationships, good for component-based design. Weakness: long class names.
- SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS): Categorizes CSS rules into Base, Layout, Module, State, and Theme. Strengths: organized structure, good for large projects. Weakness: more abstract, steeper learning curve.
- OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS): Focuses on separating structure from skin and container from content. Strengths: promotes reusability, reduces code duplication. Weakness: can lead to many small classes and more HTML markup.

Each methodology works best for different project requirements - BEM for component libraries, SMACSS for large applications, OOCSS for highly reusable UI elements.
**Frequency:** Medium (55%)
**Companies:** Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal



## 103. How would you structure CSS for a large-scale application to ensure maintainability?
**Answer:** For large-scale applications, I would implement:
1. A methodology like BEM or SMACSS for consistent naming
2. CSS architecture with clear organization (e.g., atomic design principles)
3. CSS modules or scoped styles to prevent global conflicts
4. Variables for consistent theming (custom properties)
5. Documentation for complex components and usage patterns
6. Separation of concerns (layout vs. components vs. utilities)
7. Performance considerations (code splitting, critical CSS)
8. Style linting for enforcing conventions
9. Source control best practices for CSS files
10. Testing strategy for visual regression

This approach creates maintainable, scalable CSS that multiple teams can work with.
**Frequency:** High (65%)
**Companies:** Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce, Adobe, Twitter



## 104. Explain CSS Modules and how they help solve common CSS problems.
**Answer:** CSS Modules are a way of writing CSS that automatically scopes styles to a specific component by creating unique class names during build time. This solves several common CSS problems: prevents global namespace pollution, eliminates selector specificity wars, avoids unintentional style inheritance, and reduces the need for complex naming conventions. When using CSS Modules, classnames like `.button` get transformed into something like `.Button_button_1gxM4` at build time, ensuring styles remain encapsulated to their component. This approach works particularly well with component-based architectures like React.

## 105. What CSS properties trigger layout, paint, and composite operations? How can you optimize for performance?
**Answer:** 
Properties that trigger:
- Layout (most expensive): width, height, margin, padding, display, border, top/right/bottom/left, font-size, position
- Paint (medium cost): color, background, box-shadow, visibility, text-shadow, border-radius
- Composite (least expensive): opacity, transform, filter, will-change

Performance optimization strategies:
1. Prefer transform/opacity changes for animations (composite-only)
2. Use will-change for elements that will animate
3. Avoid forced synchronous layouts (layout thrashing)
4. Batch DOM read/write operations
5. Reduce paint areas with contain: paint
6. Minimize repaint triggers during scrolling
7. Use hardware acceleration for animations via transform: translateZ(0)
8. Simplify selectors to speed up matching
**Frequency:** Medium (60%)
**Companies:** Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, Uber



## 106. Explain "critical CSS" and how would you implement it.
**Answer:** Critical CSS is an optimization technique that extracts and inlines the minimum CSS required to render the above-the-fold content of a page. This improves page load times by allowing visible content to render without waiting for external CSS files to download. 

Implementation approaches:
1. Manual extraction: Identify and extract styles for above-the-fold content
2. Automated tools: Use tools like Critical, Penthouse, or CriticalCSS
3. Build process integration: Add critical CSS extraction to webpack/gulp pipeline
4. Server-side detection: Vary critical CSS based on device/viewport
5. Delivery: Inline critical styles in <head>, then asynchronously load full CSS

This technique is particularly valuable for initial page load performance and Core Web Vitals metrics.
**Frequency:** Medium (55%)
**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Walmart, Shopify, Airbnb



## 107. How would you diagnose and fix a CSS performance issue in a production application?
**Answer:** To diagnose and fix CSS performance issues:

1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel to identify bottlenecks:
   - Record during scrolling, animations, or interactions
   - Look for long frames with layout/paint operations
   - Check "Rendering" tab for paint flashing and layout boundaries

2. Common diagnosis methods:
   - Identify frequently triggered layouts/reflows
   - Find paint-heavy areas (large or frequent)
   - Check for non-composite animations
   - Analyze unused CSS with Coverage tool
   - Measure selector matching performance

3. Common fixes:
   - Replace layout/paint properties with transform/opacity for animations
   - Add will-change for elements that animate frequently
   - Reduce selector complexity for hot paths
   - Apply content-visibility: auto for off-screen content
   - Split CSS into critical and non-critical paths
   - Remove unused CSS or implement code splitting
   - Replace expensive animations with simpler alternatives
   - Add contain: strict where appropriate

## 108. Explain CSS custom properties (variables) and provide scenarios where they're better than preprocessor variables.
**Answer:** CSS custom properties (variables) are native CSS entities defined with -- prefix and accessed with var() function. They follow the cascading rules, inherit through the DOM, and can be modified via JavaScript.

Scenarios where they're better than preprocessor variables:
1. Runtime changes: Can be updated dynamically with JavaScript without rebuilding
2. Contextual changes: Can be scoped to media queries, states, or themes
3. DOM inheritance: Values can inherit and be overridden down the DOM tree
4. Interaction with JavaScript: Can react to user interactions or application state
5. Responsive adaptations: Can change values at different breakpoints without duplication
6. Theme switching: Can update global theming without page reload
7. Progressive enhancement: Can provide fallbacks for older browsers

Example:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --primary-color: lightblue;
  }
}
.button {
  background: var(--primary-color);
}
```
**Frequency:** High (75%)
**Companies:** Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Spotify, Shopify



## 109. How would you implement dark mode using CSS variables?
**Answer:** To implement dark mode with CSS variables:

1. Define theme variables in :root:
```css
:root {
  --text-color: #333;
  --background-color: #fff;
  --heading-color: #0077cc;
  /* other theme variables */
}
```

2. Create a dark mode alternative:
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --text-color: #eee;
    --background-color: #121212;
    --heading-color: #59b0ff;
  }
}
```

3. For manual toggle, use a class:
```css
.dark-theme {
  --text-color: #eee;
  --background-color: #121212;
  --heading-color: #59b0ff;
}
```

4. Apply variables throughout your CSS:
```css
body {
  color: var(--text-color);
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: var(--heading-color);
}
```

5. Add JavaScript toggle functionality:
```javascript
const toggleButton = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');
toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');
  // Optional: store preference in localStorage
});
```

This approach enables instant theme switching without page reload and respects user system preferences.

## 110. What are CSS Houdini APIs and how do they extend CSS capabilities?
**Answer:** CSS Houdini is a set of low-level APIs that give developers direct access to the CSS Object Model (CSSOM), enabling the creation of custom CSS features without waiting for browser implementations. Main APIs include:

1. Paint API: Create custom background patterns and images with JavaScript
2. Layout API: Define custom layout algorithms beyond existing CSS layouts
3. Animation Worklet API: Run animations off the main thread for smoother performance
4. Typed OM: Structured, performance-optimized way to work with CSS values
5. Properties and Values API: Register custom properties with types and inheritance
6. Parser API: Allow custom CSS parsing rules
7. Font Metrics API: Access low-level font metrics information

Benefits include polyfilling future CSS features, creating previously impossible layouts and animations, and improving performance by working closer to the browser's rendering engine.

Example:
```js
// Registering a custom paint worklet
CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('my-paint-worklet.js');
```
```css
.element {
  background-image: paint(myCustomPaint);
}
```

## 111. How do you ensure your CSS supports accessibility requirements?
**Answer:** To ensure CSS supports accessibility:

1. Color contrast: Maintain WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   ```css
   /* Good color contrast */
   .text { color: #333; background-color: #fff; }
   ```

2. Focus states: Make focusable elements clearly visible with distinct focus styles
   ```css
   button:focus {
     outline: 3px solid #4d90fe;
     outline-offset: 2px;
   }
   ```

3. Text sizing: Use relative units (em/rem) to respect user font size preferences
   ```css
   body { font-size: 1rem; }
   h1 { font-size: 2rem; }
   ```

4. Content visibility: Avoid hiding content users need to access
   ```css
   /* Accessible hiding */
   .visually-hidden {
     position: absolute;
     height: 1px;
     width: 1px;
     overflow: hidden;
     clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);
     white-space: nowrap;
   }
   ```

5. Hover/focus parity: Ensure hover effects also work for keyboard
   ```css
   .button:hover, .button:focus { background-color: #0056b3; }
   ```

6. Text spacing: Accommodate custom user text spacing
   ```css
   p { line-height: 1.5; }
   ```

7. Reduced motion: Support reduced motion preferences
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     .animation { animation: none; }
   }
   ```

8. Print styles: Ensure content remains accessible when printed
   ```css
   @media print { 
     .no-print { display: none; }
     body { font-size: 12pt; }
   }
   ```

## 112. Explain how to use CSS to support users with visual impairments.
**Answer:** Supporting users with visual impairments through CSS:

1. Text size and scaling:
   ```css
   html { font-size: 100%; /* Respect browser settings */ }
   body { font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5; }
   ```

2. High contrast mode detection:
   ```css
   @media (forced-colors: active) {
     button { forced-color-adjust: none; }
   }
   ```

3. Focus indicators:
   ```css
   :focus {
     outline: 3px solid #4d90fe;
     outline-offset: 2px;
   }
   ```

4. Non-color information cues:
   ```css
   .error {
     color: #d32f2f;
     border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f;
     padding-left: 1rem;
   }
   ```

5. Font choices for readability:
   ```css
   body {
     font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
     letter-spacing: 0.01em;
   }
   ```

## 113. What CSS considerations should be made for users who prefer reduced motion?
**Answer:** For users who prefer reduced motion:

1. Detect the preference:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     /* Reduced motion styles */
   }
   ```

2. Replace or reduce animations:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     * {
       animation-duration: 0.001ms !important;
       animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
       transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Provide alternative static presentations:
   ```css
   .card {
     transition: transform 0.3s ease;
   }
   .card:hover {
     transform: scale(1.05);
   }
   
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     .card {
       transition: none;
     }
     .card:hover {
       transform: none;
       box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #4d90fe; /* Alternative hover state */
     }
   }
   ```

4. Consider scroll behavior:

## 114. Compare CSS-in-JS solutions (like styled-components or Emotion) with traditional CSS approaches.
**Answer:** CSS-in-JS vs Traditional CSS:

**CSS-in-JS Advantages:**
1. Component-scoped styles with automatic unique class names
2. No global namespace conflicts
3. Dynamic styling based on props/state
4. Dead code elimination (only used styles are included)
5. Colocation of styles with components
6. JavaScript variables shared with styles
7. Runtime evaluation and theme application
8. TypeScript integration for style props

**Traditional CSS Advantages:**
1. Separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
2. Browser caching of CSS files
3. No runtime style generation overhead
4. Works without JavaScript
5. Easier for CSS specialists without JS knowledge
6. Standard tooling (linters, formatters)
7. No framework lock-in
8. Better browser devtools support

**Performance Considerations:**
- CSS-in-JS may have runtime performance cost
- Traditional CSS loads and parses separately from JS
- CSS-in-JS often creates more granular style rules
- Critical CSS extraction can be more complex with CSS-in-JS

**Examples:**
Styled-components:
```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${props => props.primary ? '#0077cc' : 'white'};
  color: ${props => props.primary ? 'white' : '#0077cc'};
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
`;
```

Traditional CSS:
```css
.button { padding: 0.5rem 1rem; }
.button-primary { background: #0077cc; color: white; }
.button-secondary { background: white; color: #0077cc; }
```

## 115. What are the performance implications of CSS-in-JS?
**Answer:** Performance implications of CSS-in-JS:

**Potential Performance Costs:**
1. Runtime overhead for style generation and injection
2. JavaScript bundle size increases
3. Additional CPU work for style processing
4. Memory usage for style objects and runtime processing
5. Style recalculation on prop changes
6. Runtime CSS injection can block rendering
7. Time-to-Interactive may be delayed

**Performance Benefits:**
1. Critical CSS extraction is often automatic
2. Only used styles are included (tree-shaking)
3. Modern solutions use style extraction at build time
4. Component-based chunking aligns with code-splitting
5. Avoids unused CSS rules in the global scope

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. Server-side rendering of critical styles
2. Static extraction when possible (zero-runtime solutions)
3. Memoization of styled components
4. Sharing style instances across components
5. Using "zero runtime" CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., Linaria)

**Comparison:**
- Static CSS: Fastest initial load, no runtime cost
- Runtime CSS-in-JS: More flexible, potentially slower initial render
- Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS: Balance between both approaches

Modern CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion, styled-components (v5+), and Stitches have optimized for performance, but still have some overhead compared to static CSS.

## 116. How would you implement a theme switching system with CSS?
**Answer:** To implement a theme switching system:

**Method 1: CSS Variables (Modern approach)**
```css
/* Define themes */
:root {
  /* Light theme (default) */
  --color-background: #ffffff;
  --color-text: #333333;
  --color-primary: #0077cc;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-background: #121212;
  --color-text: #f0f0f0;
  --color-primary: #59b0ff;
}

/* Apply variables */
body {
  background-color: var(--color-background);
  color: var(--color-text);
}
```

```javascript
// Theme switcher
function toggleTheme() {
  const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme') || 'light';
  const newTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
  
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
  localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
}

// Load saved theme
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  if (savedTheme) {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', savedTheme);
  } else if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
  }
});
```

**Method 2: Class-based (Better compatibility)**
```css
/* Light theme (default) */
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #333333;
}

/* Dark theme */
body.dark-theme {
  background-color: #121212;
  color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

**Additional Features:**
1. Transition between themes:
```css
body {
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}
```

2. Theme-specific images:
```css
.theme-image {
  content: var(--theme-image-url);
}
```

3. System preference detection:

## 117. Explain your approach to debugging complex CSS issues across browsers.
**Answer:** My approach to cross-browser CSS debugging:

**1. Systematic Investigation:**
   - Start with browser developer tools to inspect elements
   - Compare computed styles between browsers
   - Isolate the issue by creating a minimal test case
   - Use feature detection rather than browser detection

**2. Common Cross-Browser Issues & Solutions:**
   - Flexbox: Add appropriate prefixes, avoid mix of flex and min/max constraints
   - Grid: Provide fallbacks for older browsers
   - Height calculations: Check box-sizing differences
   - Font rendering: Use web-safe font stacks or font-display
   - Default margins/padding: Use a CSS reset/normalize

**3. Tools & Techniques:**
   - BrowserStack/LambdaTest for testing in multiple environments
   - Feature detection with @supports
   - Autoprefixer for vendor prefix management
   - CSS linting for compatibility warnings
   - Visual regression testing tools to catch rendering differences

**4. Debugging Process:**
   - Add temporary debugging styles (e.g., borders, backgrounds)
   - Incrementally remove or add CSS to isolate problem
   - Test with different content lengths/sizes
   - Check parent element styles that might affect children
   - Validate HTML structure

**5. Documentation:**
   - Document browser-specific fixes with comments
   - Create a pattern library of cross-browser components
   - Maintain a knowledge base of workarounds
   - Add browser support notes to component documentation

**6. Edge Cases:**
   - Handle print styles separately
   - Test with different pixel densities
   - Check both mouse and touch interactions
   - Validate RTL language support

## 118. How would you refactor legacy CSS code for a large application?
**Answer:** Refactoring legacy CSS approach:

**1. Assessment & Planning:**
   - Audit existing CSS (size, specificity, duplication)
   - Identify unused CSS with coverage tools
   - Define coding standards and methodology (BEM, SMACSS, etc.)
   - Create visual inventory of UI components
   - Define CSS architecture that aligns with application structure

**2. Incremental Approach:**
   - Start with global styles (typography, colors, spacing)
   - Extract variables/custom properties for consistency
   - Adopt the "strangler pattern" - build new system alongside old
   - Create isolation for new components to prevent conflicts
   - Replace components one by one rather than full rewrite

**3. Technical Implementation:**
   - Move from global styles to component encapsulation
   - Reduce specificity by flattening selectors
   - Remove !important declarations systematically
   - Replace hardcoded values with variables
   - Organize code with logical file structure
   - Add comments for complex sections

**4. Testing & QA:**
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Create component documentation
   - Test across browsers and viewports
   - Add safeguards against future specificity problems

**5. Performance Optimization:**
   - Remove duplicate declarations
   - Combine similar rules
   - Split CSS into logical chunks (critical/non-critical)
   - Reduce selector complexity

**6. Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Document patterns and standards
   - Create living style guide
   - Train team on new architecture
   - Set up linting to maintain quality

This approach balances immediate improvements with systematic refactoring while minimizing risk.

## 119. What strategies do you use to test CSS across different browsers and devices?
**Answer:** Strategies for cross-browser/device CSS testing:

**1. Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Browser testing services (BrowserStack, LambdaTest, Sauce Labs)
   - Device labs for physical testing
   - Virtual machines with different browser versions
   - Responsive design mode in DevTools
   - Mobile emulators and simulators

**2. Automated Testing:**
   - Visual regression testing (Percy, BackstopJS, Chromatic)
   - Screenshot comparison across browsers
   - CSS linting with browser compatibility rules
   - Automated reports for CSS usage and support

**3. Development Practices:**
   - Progressive enhancement approach
   - Feature detection with @supports
   - Graceful degradation fallbacks
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Using Autoprefixer for vendor prefixes

**4. Test Coverage Approach:**
   - Define browser support matrix (primary/secondary)
   - Prioritize testing for high-traffic browsers/devices
   - Create test scenarios for specific CSS features
   - Test extremes (old browsers, small screens, large screens)
   - Test with different font sizes and zoom levels

**5. Common Test Cases:**
   - Layout integrity at various viewports
   - Hover/focus states work consistently
   - Touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Font rendering consistency
   - Animation performance
   - Print stylesheet testing
   - RTL language support

**6. Workflow Integration:**
   - Incorporate testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Pre-commit hooks for CSS validation
   - Collaborative bug tracking system
   - Document known issues and workarounds

## 120. How do you handle CSS for print layouts?
**Answer:** Handling CSS for print layouts:

**1. Print-specific Stylesheet:**
```css
/* Option 1: Separate print stylesheet */
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">

/* Option 2: Media query in main CSS */
@media print {
  /* Print-specific styles */
}
```

**2. Key Print Considerations:**
```css
@media print {
  /* Hide non-essential elements */
  nav, footer, .ads, .comments, .no-print {
    display: none !important;
  }
  
  /* Ensure background colors/images print */
  * {
    -webkit-print-color-adjust: exact !important;
    print-color-adjust: exact !important;
  }
  
  /* Optimize text for reading */
  body {
    font-size: 12pt;
    line-height: 1.5;
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
    color: #000;
    background: #fff;
  }
  
  /* Ensure links are useful in printed form */
  a {
    color: #000;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  a[href]:after {
    content: " (" attr(href) ")";
    font-size: 90%;
  }
  
  /* Avoid breaking elements across pages */
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, img {
    page-break-after: avoid;
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }
  
  /* Control page breaks */
  .page-break {
    page-break-before: always;
  }
  
  /* Expand content to full width */
  .container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  
  /* Make tables more readable */
  table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid #000;
  }
}
```

**3. Advanced Techniques:**
- Control widow/orphan text:
```css
p {
  orphans: 3;
  widows: 3;
}
```

- Add print-specific content:
```css
.print-only {
  display: none;
}
@media print {
  .print-only {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

- Page size and orientation:
```css
@page {
  size: letter portrait;
  margin: 2cm;
}
```

**4. Testing Print Styles:**
- Use browser print preview
- Test across browsers (particularly Chrome and Firefox)
- Check PDF output
- Validate with different paper sizes
- Test with and without background colors/images setting enabled
